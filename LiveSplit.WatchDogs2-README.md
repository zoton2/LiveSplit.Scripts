# "Watch_Dogs 2" Autosplitter and Load Remover

## How to install

1. In the LiveSplit splits editor, make sure your game is set to "Watch_Dogs 2" (without quotes) and then click the "Activate" button.
2. Disable **EasyAntiCheat** for the game; this can be done by adding the `-eac_launcher` command line option. This is needed because it blocks the game's memory from being read. The game should alert you that this has worked on start up; if it doesn't, try restarting your computer and then launching the game again.
    - See [this PCGamingWiki article](http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Glossary:Command_line_arguments) for how to go about doing this.
3. In LiveSplit, set "Game Time" as your main timing method; right-click the main window > Compare Against > Game Time. (Both real time and time without loads are stored in your splits regardless.)

## What is autosplit?

*(All autospliting is based on the percentage for your current save/playthrough, except for the starting split, "Walk in the Park", and "Sunday Schooled 1", which are based on subtitles.)*
- Must have No Compromise and Human Conditions DLC uninstalled for the percentages to match up with the autosplitter script. Must also follow the speedrun route in the WR.
  
- Starting split (once you gain control of Marcus).
- Splits for most individual main missions, and has options to enable/disable them.
- Splits for "Walk in the Park", "Sunday Schooled" and "Mark Up" if enabled in settings (default is disabled).
  - **"Walk in the Park" and "Sunday Schooled 1" do not always split properly due to subtitles being skipped.**
- Still have to manual split for the last split when completing Motherload (last mission).
  
Does not support splitting for these individual missions/cutscenes & calls:
- Intro mission/stuff before "Walk in the Park"
- Newly Dawned ("False Profits")
- ICU (Wrench cutscene at start of "Heist Sweet Heist")
- Zero Days ("Heist Sweet Heist")
- Trouble at Home ("Looking Glass")
- Second Wind ("Alphabet Soup")
- Nine Lives ("Hacker War")
- Caf√© Culture ("W4tched")
- The Waiting Game ("Hack teh World")
- Spinal Tap ("Shanghaied")
- Social Media and the Congressman ("Power to the Sheeple")
- Like Minds ("Robot Wars")
- Motherload call (for mission to show up)

## Versions supported

This load remover *should* work for copies bought from any storefront. Your current version is visible in the main menu and the pause menu. I advise you disable automatic updating of your game if possible, because new versions will not be supported straight away. **Autosplitting is not supported on all versions! (see notes below)**
